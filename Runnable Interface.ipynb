    "* <b>Modularity:</b> When you run a thread and it finishes running, there is no way to restart it. This could lead to a lot of code duplication in case of multithreading, where you need a certain task to run a number of times. Fortunately, you can create a Runnable instance which can be reused in any number of threads.    \n",

    "* <b>Ease of use:</b> Runnable only has one method, public void run(). It accepts no arguments and is as simple as possible. Thread has many methods that need to be taken into account making it very cumbersome to work with, and the extra overhead is always an issue.                 \n",
